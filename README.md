# isomorphic-demo

Work in progress example web app. The app code is run on first request on the server then the app state is passed to the client and the app continues running there for a seamless user experience.


This 'Holy Grail' approach is made possibly by:

* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
* The [Flux architechture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)

And

* Yahoo's [Flux implementation](https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples)
* [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)

## Running

```
npm install
npm start
```
